# How did we meet?
**Alejo:** something something.  
<br> <br>
**Monique:** I moved to Pittsburgh 'after' COVID in Spring 2021, in doing so I was trying to meet new people and make friends; I joined two different soccer teams. The second team was the friendlier of the two, we ended up all hanging after our games. We started talking and learned we had a shared interest in road trips. And that's where it all started. Nearly two years of friendship and adventures later, we chose to start our romantic relationship together, and here we are! 
<br> <br>

# How did the proposal go down?
**Alejo:**  
<br> <br>
**Monique:** On day 3 of a surprise birthday trip to Portugal Alejandro wanted to go explore a beaitufl beach just south of Porto. We arrived at a still sleepy practically empty beach. Just off in the distance there happened to be a chapel, and I enthusiastically wanted to go see it. Upon approaching the chapel Alejandro got more nervous, and me more concerned, until I noticed he stopped. Right in front of the steps of the chapel on the rock, he asked me to marry him.  
<br> <br>

# Who asked whom out first? 
**Alejo:**  
<br> <br>
**MT:** I'm not entirely sure. Looking back it's hard to tell when our 'first date' really was. 
<br> <br>

# What is our favorite trait about the other person?
**Alejo:**  
<br> <br>
**Monique:** He's my type of weird. A more serious answer is that he's incredibly thoughtful of and committed to the people he loves. 
<br> <br>

# Name one quirky trait/memory about each other.
**Alejo:** 
<br> <br>
**Monique:** There are so many memories, across so many continents. I think my favourite memory is of the feeling of coming home from work and spending a cozy evening together. A More descriptive memory is of driving home from a roadtrip at midnight still a few hours to go blasting the radio singing our hearts out to our roadtrip playlist.
<br> <br>

# What is our favorite travel memory together?
**Alejo:** 
<br> <br>
**Monique:** That time we never actually made it to inca inca beach in Colombia. In short, we spent an afternoon on a sailboat cruise, and just absolutely froze, soaking wet in the middle of a rainstorm, instead of going to a mediocre beach on the coast near Santa Marta.
