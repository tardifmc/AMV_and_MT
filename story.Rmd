# How did we meet?
**J:** We sat down next to each other in our English literature class the first semester of college. We've been stuck together since. Leslie still proofreads my emails and essays!
<br> <br>
**L:** I walked up to Jina and went "How you doin'?"
<br> <br>

# How did the proposal go down?
**J:** I came to Pittsburgh to visit Leslie and we had a game night at our friend Monique's apartment. It was a Pokemon-themed game night and there was even a Pokemon-version Monopoly board! We played for a while and when it became my turn, I landed on the Chance spot. I went to draw a card but instead, Leslie picked one for me. It was a Pokémon card that said, "Will you marry me? If you say yes, then you will gain a player two forever." 
<br> <br>
**L:** We played board games.
<br> <br>

# Who asked whom out first? 
**J:** For the record, I asked Leslie out first. 
<br> <br>
**L:** See Leslie's response to question #1.
<br> <br>

# What is our favorite trait about the other person?
**J:** He makes me feel loved and secure. 
<br> <br>
**L:** She feels like home.
<br> <br>

# Name one quirky trait/memory about each other.
**J:** I have so many I could list off for Leslie. He might not look like it, but Leslie loves all things that are cute, especially animals. We went to a destination wedding last year and he spent most of the time petting and feeding the stray cats and dogs. We also traveled to Japan recently and he brought a bag of cat food so he could feed any stray cats. 
<br> <br>
**L:** Jina used Glare. It's super effective!
<br> <br>

# What is our favorite Pokémon?
**J:** Too many to pick, but definitely between Eevee, Riolu, or Latios.
<br> <br>
**L:** Squirtle
